# Project Overview: Spam and Ham Classifier
The Spam and Ham Classifier project aims to identify and categorize emails as either spam (unwanted messages) or ham (legitimate messages) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.
Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown of each project phase:

## Data Preprocessing:
We use the NLTK library to clean and prepare email text. This involves tokenization (splitting text into individual words), stop word removal (filtering out common words with little contextual value), and stemming (reducing words to their root form). This step ensures that the model receives relevant information, enhancing its accuracy.

## Data Visualization: 
To understand the patterns in the text data, we visualize word frequencies and other features that help us differentiate between spam and ham emails. This includes plotting word distributions and identifying commonly used terms in each category.

## Model Training and Evaluation:
After preprocessing, we train machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, to classify emails. The model is evaluated on accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure its effectiveness in correctly identifying spam and ham emails.

**This project provides a practical application of NLP for handling and classifying email data, a crucial task in maintaining clean and efficient communication systems.**
